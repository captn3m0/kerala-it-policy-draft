# I.T. Policy Framework 2017

This document contains the Information Technology Policy Framework of the Government of Kerala

---

![](cm.JPG "Pinarayi Vijayan")

# Message from the Chief Minister

With the most pleasure I am presenting the IT policy framework of the Government aiming to boost the IT sector driven economy in the State. The Policy of the Government is to make use of the digital technology for the overall development of the State and to ensure quick and efficient delivery of all essential services. The State has the potential to bridge the digital divide prevalent.

Kerala has a strong infrastructure and human resource strength to adopt digital facilities. Educated people, moderate standard of living etc. are all facilitating factors. We need to leap forward attracting substantial investment in IT sector and identifying and promoting young entrepreneurs through start ups.

Digital technology is imperative not only for the development of modern industries but for the general well being of the State also. This is possible through three ways. Firstly when I.T. is integrated with manufacturing sector its efficiency increases. Rendering of Government service to people efficiently is the second possibility. Thirdly, employment opportunities can be generated by using the possibilities in software development and hardware production. This will help realize the government intention of laying a strong foundation for a vibrant new Kerala.

An efficient governance system is essential to ensure - accelerated industrial growth and implementation of novel and creative schemes. The unlimited opportunities of internet of things, social media, mobility analytics and cloud computing will give a boost to conceiving and articulation of new ideas. Moreover the thrust of government in infrastructure development, human resource development and overall economic development will open up large opportunities for the meaningful use of Information Technology and make these initiatives effectively comprehensive.

It is indeed commendable to find that more than 90% of Keralites have been enrolled in the Aadhaar card programs. In this context government intends to implement the KYC facility through Aadhaar based biometric system. At the same time e-Services of government would not be denied to citizens for want of Aadhaar and it will be ensured through other basic proofs of identity.

For the first the the government intends to publish a sub policy statement relating to various sections along with the main document. It is proposed to update the sub policy documents in an yearly interval to ensure refining the same on the basis of the fast changing scenario in technology and its applications.

Another speciality of this draft document is that it allows the public and experts in the field to contribute their suggestions and inputs, which shall be examined on merit and appropriately incorporated in the final document.

Let us all work together to create a 'NAVAKERALAM'.

# VISION

Establish Kerala a Knowledge Powered Digital Society by 2020 through application of Digital Technologies in areas of Digital Citizenship, Digital Lifestyle and Digital commerce; within the governing principles of Freedom, Ubiquity, Inclusion, Transparency, Safety and Security for all; aligned to technology trends, citizen and industry needs; to provide overall social and economic empowerment of citizens

# 1. Introduction

The State of Kerala has always been working towards adoption and application of Information & Communication Technology (lC) be it the services/support to its citizens or enabling smoother functioning of the business community. Numerous initiatives have been taken up over the years, which have enabled the State to intervene effectively in implementing ICT projects and to be a pioneer in E-governance activities.

The State has been successful in creating a robust Electronics Delivery of Service infrastructure in terms of State wide area network, Data centers and citizen service centers. There has been a good amount of work that has gone into creating a sustainable model for Akshaya, the network of IT entrepreneurs who work under the Brand on a license agreement to deliver public services. Akshaya is one of the most lauded and successful citizen service delivery center models in the country and in the world. The centrally monitored but loosely structured governance mechanism gives it the flexibility and operational nimbleness and at the same time ensures the security and authenticity of public service delivery.

Even though the first IT park and first electronic enterprise were started in Kerala , today we lag behind in software exports and electronics industry.
